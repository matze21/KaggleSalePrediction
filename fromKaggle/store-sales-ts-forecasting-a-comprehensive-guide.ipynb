However, you know that Kaggle gives us splitted two data as train and test. The dates in the test data are for the **15 days** after the last date in the training data. Date range in the test data will be very important to us while we are defining a cross-validation strategy and creating new features.\n",

    "**<code>The train data</code>** contains time series of the stores and the product families combination. The sales column gives the total sales for a product family at a particular store at a given date. Fractional values are possible since products can be sold in fractional units (1.5 kg of cheese, for instance, as opposed to 1 bag of chips).The onpromotion column gives the total number of items in a product family that were being promoted at a store at a given date.\n",

    "**<code>Stores data</code>** gives some information about stores such as city, state, type, cluster.\n",

    "**<code>Transaction data</code>** is highly correlated with train's sales column. You can understand the sales patterns of the stores.\n",

    "**<code>Holidays and events data</code>** is a meta data. This data is quite valuable to understand past sales, trend and seasonality components. However, it needs to be arranged. You are going to find a comprehensive data manipulation for this data. That part will be one of the most important chapter in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**<code>Daily Oil Price data</code>** is another data which will help us. Ecuador is an oil-dependent country and it's economical health is highly vulnerable to shocks in oil prices.
