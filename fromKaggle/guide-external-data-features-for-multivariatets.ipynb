    "## How external data & features might help on Kaggle?\n",
    "Kaggle is always about learning and leader board progress (hopefully from learning, not cheating ;-))  \n",
    "And every Kaggler wants to progress as fast as possible, so time saving tips & tricks is a big deal as well.  \n",
    "That's why low-code tools is adopted among kagglers.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, there are **two major scenarios** of external features & data introduction in competitions on Kaggle:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Final improvement of a polished kernel**  \n",
    "In this scenario you want **to improve already polished kernel** (optimized features, model architecture and hyperparams) with new external features.  \n",
    "Before that, most of the juice already has been \"squeezed\" from competition data by significant efforts in feature engineering.  \n",
    "And you want to answer the simple question - *Is there any external data sources and features which might boost accuracy a bit more?*  \n",
    "However, there is a caveat to this approach: current model architecture & hyperparameters might be suboptimal for the new feature set, after introduction even single new var.  \n",
    "So, extra step back for model tuning might be needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Low-code initial feature engineering - add relevant external features @start**  \n",
    "Here you want to **save time on feature search and engineering**. If there are some ready-to-use external features and data, let's use it to speed up the overall progress.  \n",
    "In this scenario always make sense to check that new external features have optimal representation for specific task and target model architecture. Example - category features for linear regression models should be one-hot-encoded.\n",
    "This type of feature preparation should be done manually in any case.  \n",
    "Same as scenario #1, there is a caveat to this approach: a lot of features not always a good thing - they might lead to dimensionality increase and model overfitting.  \n",
    "You have to check model accuracy improvement metrics after enrichment with the new features and ALWAYS with appropriate cross-validation strategy.\n",
    " \n",
    "In this Guide we'll go with **Scenario #1**. Also you can check out Part #2 Guide for the [**Scenario #2**](https://www.kaggle.com/code/romaupgini/zero-feature-engineering-with-upgini-pycaret), and another example for Scenario #1 - [Part 1](https://www.kaggle.com/code/romaupgini/how-to-find-external-data-for-1-private-lb-4-50)"
