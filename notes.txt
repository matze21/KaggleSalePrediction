ideas:
- build calender -> all general time info
- train for every store & every item separately

Problem:
- missing trends of single store (feature for overall sales)
	- might depend on location,..
- missing trends of all stores   (feature for countrywide sales)
	- want to train stores together since there might be dependencies between them (or make it into feature)


Transacations:
- can't use since no test data for it -> find correlation (time or feature) & use that


TODO:
1. build calender DF + suggested featuers from notebook
2. build store specific features (check correlation transaction & store)
3. train for every store & item separately
4. use date as feature & train everything toether (need to broadcast calender DF)
